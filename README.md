# Eventcamera_SMLM_benchmarking repository


## Introduction 

Event cameras, sometimes also referred as neuromorphic vision sensors, are fast asynchronous light detectors. Their pixels independently monitor light intensity change with microsecond level precision and return signals whenever the intensity changes exceed preset threshold. For further details about event camera, there is a nice review from [Gallego et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9138762). There have been several implementations of event-based microscopy$([Cabriel et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-023-01308-8) ,[Ruipeng et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-024-01502-5). $). However, there are still a many potentials of event camera left unexplored. This repository aims to provide benchmarking procedures and results for using event cameras as detectors for microscopy.
